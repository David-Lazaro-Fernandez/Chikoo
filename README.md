## Problematic ðŸš©

During the last 5 years in Mexico there has been a great increase in the demand for the services of clinics adjacent to pharmacies and care in public services, according to data obtained from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition. More than 65% of Mexicans who are affiliated with a public health institution prefer to carry out their medical consultation in this type of office.

This, coupled with the more than 46 million Mexicans who do not have health insurance, has meant that consumption in offices adjacent to pharmacies and public services has grown exponentially, to levels where the simple fact of making a consultation In these types of establishments, can take up to more than 3 hours, since many Mexicans prefer to use these establishments because they are not expensive and are very well located.

And this is a story that more and more Mexicans are living at the national level, if we go to any of these establishments we will find completely full waiting rooms or even lines that extend to the outside of the establishment.


## How can we solve this? âœ‹

When medical consultations are carried out, most of the time is spent in an interrogation to be able to fill out the patient's medical history and to learn more about him. This is so that doctors can generate an efficient consultation based on your medical history.

But **what if we support the doctors to make this interrogation a faster and simpler process so that the efficiency with which the consultations are carried out is greater?** ðŸ¤“


## Meet Chikoo ðŸ’œ

Meet Chikoo (Or Francis in Mazateco), a chatbot that will help you during your journey when filling out your pre-consultation data on your own. Chikoo makes filling in your data as simple as answering a question with an SMS message or making a call to our personal number and filling in your data by voice.

Chikoo will help you fill in the data that is essential for your doctor, with the aim of making your consultation a better experience.

You will simply have to answer a number of questions that range from your personal information, family history to what brought you to a medical consultation?

Once you have finished this, chikoo will send you a link with a QR code that you can use in your next consultation. This QR is used so that your doctor can see all the data that you gave Chikoo and can make a diagnosis quickly and simply.
