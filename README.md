## Problematic

> During the last 5 years in Mexico there has been a great increase in the demand for the services of clinics adjacent to pharmacies and care in public services, according to data obtained from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition. More than 65% of Mexicans who are affiliated with a public health institution prefer to carry out their medical consultation in this type of office.

> This, coupled with the more than 46 million Mexicans who do not have health insurance, has meant that consumption in offices adjacent to pharmacies and public services has grown exponentially, to levels where the simple fact of making a consultation In these types of establishments, can take up to more than 3 hours, since many Mexicans prefer to use these establishments because they are not expensive and are very well located.

> And this is a story that more and more Mexicans are living at the national level, if we go to any of these establishments we will find completely full waiting rooms or even lines that extend to the outside of the establishment.

## How can we solve this?

> When medical consultations are carried out, most of the time is spent in an interrogation to be able to fill out the patient's medical history and to learn more about him. This is so that doctors can generate an efficient consultation based on your medical history.

> But **what if we support the doctors to make this interrogation a faster and simpler process so that the efficiency with which the consultations are carried out is greater?**
